Today, I had really a good chance to move Magento Shop from Development Enviournment to Product Enviornment. On that course I faced some big difficulty in moving the database. I already had the files and DB of the development enviornment, imporing DB was a PIA. I uploaded all the files, which was easy. And next thing I did was uploaded DB dumpped files to root of Magento. Then I logged into SSH and logged into MYSQL. Then Used the following commands to import the dumpped DB files. But first made the database say "magento".

[source language='sql']
/**Using the Previously created DB**/
mysql> use magento

/**Import the Dumpped SQL**/
mysql>source pathToMagentoRoot/mySql.sql

[/source]


So after the command is executed I had the whole DB on production enviornment. Similarly we can also import dumpped data of Production on Local database running on WAMP server.
To import Dumpped SQL data on WAMP, first create a database, say magento and then use the following commands

[source language='sql']
/**
	Using the Previously created DB.
	-p password part is optional if you have not configured password for MYSQL locally
	-u Username (root by default)
**/

mysql> C:\wamp\bin\mysql\mysql5.0.51b\bin>mysql.exe -use magento -u root -p password

/**Import the Dumpped SQL**/
mysql>source pathToSQLSource/mySql.sql

[/source]

By Now we have the database synced between Local and Production. Next is configuring the database name used by Magento. Browse to app/etc/local.xml and change in the following part.

[source language="xml"]
    <connection>
                    <host><![CDATA[localhost
                    username_here
                    password_here
                    databasename_here
                    1
    
[/source]

Finally, browsed through table core_config_data and find value of path: web/unsecure/base_url and path: web/secure/base_url and change their values accordingly.

Now I had my Shop enviorment switched. Most work for you as well. LOL.]]>
