Magento as you might know or not! has really a very PIA (Pain in the A**) type of methods to create SQL, execute and fetch! There are two ways of getting SQL from the collection of Magento. Here are the two ways.

<strong>1. Only Echoing Query String.</strong>
For just echoing the query string you must call printlogquery(), method the the collection. Like.
[source language="php"]
/** If $collection is your collection**/
$collection->printlogquery(true);
/** Don't forget to write true in param**/
[/source]

But by this method you cannot assign the query you get echoed to some variable. To get the query string here is what you do.

<strong>2. Getting the query String</strong>
[source language="php"]
$query=$collection->getSelectSql(true);
echo $query;
[/source]

You can then use this $query to concat with more query, in some cases you desperately need this.

Stay Tuned!
