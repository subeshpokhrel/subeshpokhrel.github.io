TTT has made another very handy Magento module available in Magento Connect and the best part is its free. The Three Tree My Filter Module will allow the administrator save the grid filter for Customer Grid, Product Grid and Order Grid. Those filters can be set to be shown in the menu. And when the listing in the menu is clicked the filters for the grid is automatically set and data will be displayed accordingly. This will remove the clumsy work of setting the filters of the grid every time when you want to get specific set of result in the grid. 

For example if you want to see only Simple product in the product grid, you must always select the product type as simple and then hit search. But using the module you will only have to hit search once. Then save the filter and and add the filter to the menu. You can then directly click on the menu of Custom Filter and get the required result.

We would be glad to hear your response on the module.
