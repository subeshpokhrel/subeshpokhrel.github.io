Here is a small snippet of code, yet useful, to get ordered items and its details. I've deviced this code a lot before and posted in Magento Commerce's Forum as well. But felt like writting it again, so that I can have a quick refrence to it as well. Next thing, I've tried a lot to get all orders and their items details by single query, but have not yet come up with a solution. If you have any method of finding order and its details by a single query, then please do response. The code below first needs an order ID as it parameters to give order details.

[source language="php"]
$order = Mage::getModel('sales/order')-&gt;load($order_id);
$items = $order-&gt;getAllItems();
$itemcount=count($items);
$name=array();
$unitPrice=array();
$sku=array();
$ids=array();
$qty=array();
foreach ($items as $itemId =&gt; $item)
{
	$name[] = $item-&gt;getName();
	$unitPrice[]=$item-&gt;getPrice();
	$sku[]=$item-&gt;getSku();
	$ids[]=$item-&gt;getProductId();
	$qty[]=$item-&gt;getQtyToInvoice();
}
[/source]

Hope this might "just" help somebody in need.
