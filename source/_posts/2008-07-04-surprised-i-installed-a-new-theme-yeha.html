I was just wandering through the themes factories of wordpress I came across this theme BlueUzor by skinpress, had a demo view and I had opened the last theme I installed on the tab of mozilla. Then I compared the two.. I thought what a bad choice I had before! :D

Later on I saw another BlueMechanics theme designed by skinpress, then I had an idea of fusing the two with modifications. And this is the result. How do you like this theme?

Don't be surprised later.. I may change this too.. D: ... You will never know..
