I recently got to a situation where I needed to add a new frontend template for some module and after some action show the error or success message. Not the first time though :P. Interesting thing was even if I added this code in the PHTML file.

[source language="php"]

&lt;?php echo $this-&gt;getMessagesBlock()-&gt;getGroupedHtml() ?&gt;

[/source]

It did not work. Yes, after adding this block it had worked before. In my case, the probable case might be that I had called the module's template from CMS page. In other case it should work. So, I looked for work around and the following did the trick.

[source language="php"]
// Getting Messages from Session
$messages=Mage::getSingleton(&quot;customer/session&quot;)-&gt;getMessages();

// Creating Block Mage_Core_Block_Messages
// Setting Message
// echoing the Message's HTML
echo $this-&gt;getLayout()-&gt;createBlock(&quot;core/messages&quot;)-&gt;setMessages($messages)-&gt;getGroupedHtml();

[/source]

The Error/Success or Notice messages are set on session. So what I did was take those message/s from the session and create a new block, same as what <strong>$this->getMessagesBlock()</strong> might have called, and set those message to the created block and echoed its HTML.

Clever? or not?
