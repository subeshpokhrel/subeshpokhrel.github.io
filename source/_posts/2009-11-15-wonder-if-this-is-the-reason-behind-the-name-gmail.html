I was working in Magento trying to print PDF of the shipping information, with out changing the locale of the site and it was set to "Dutch". And I came up with this word "gemailed", I pronounced it as "G-Mailed". Then suddenly my mind clicked with a connection G-Mailed and Gmail. So i thought it would be a good (if not better) discovery and share on my blog. Here's the screen shot of the translation.

This is not any official thing or anything, just a mere coincidence, but really a thing to think about for once any may be crack a joke or say it to your friends.
