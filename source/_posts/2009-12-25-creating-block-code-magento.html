Here are some methods of creating block by code in Magento. This type of code can be used directly in template, not need to create a layout file or add a child node inside already existing layout file. You can use this to echo a different type of block inside already loading block and template.

[source language="php"]
// Directly in the PHTML where you want to show the block
<?php
echo $this->getLayout()->createBlock("module/block")->setTemplate("module/page.phtml")->toHtml();
?>
[/source]

What we have actually done is just load the layout and create an instance of a block class defined inside its paramerter, then assigned a template to the block and finally echoed as html. Simple! The code above will be equivalent to what we do as following in layout and in template file.

[source language='xml']
// In layout
<block type="module/block" name="module.name" template="module/page.html"/>
[/source]

[source language="php"]
<?php
// In parent PHTML
$this->getChildHtml("module.name");
?>
[/source]

May be helpful!
