Have you ever tried searching for "<strong>Google" on Google</strong>? You might have or not, I don't know, but when I asked to one of my friend he gave me a very humorous answer. He said it would go into a "<strong>infinite loop</strong>".
Mathematically speaking <strong>R=G(G)</strong>, here R is Result and G stands for searching in Google, where the searching parameter is itself Google (G). So, when you break it up or simplify this we can see as follows:

R=G(G)
R=G(G(G))
R=G(G(G(G)))...

So there is a never ending loop.
I don't know if this is the "most absurd" deduction, but still you can think about it and just laugh :D

Those were all the fancy part of the post. I mean just to make the post seem humorous. Now I actually Googled for Google on Google. Google showed up with some of these "interesting" results.

<strong>Result Analysis I:</strong>

<a href='http://subesh.com.np/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/google1.jpg'><img src="http://subesh.com.np/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/google1.jpg" alt="" title="google1" width="500" height="174" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-74" /></a>
This is the first result shown. As you can see it shows up with a www.google.com, with meta-description or title or the striped content
<code>Enables users to search the Web, Usenet, and images. Features include PageRank, caching and translation of results, and an option to find similar pages.</code>
And when you carefully observer the HTML codes of www.google.com, then you can see no such text (not even hidden) in the page, not in its meta content as well. So how is this possible, untill... someone injects that... someone who has the authority. You can think of anyone.. notes,books,page or heart,lungs,brain.. any one...
There were similar things happening with googlemaps,googlevideos,googlereader.......

<strong>Result Analysis II:</strong>

<img src='http://www.thechurchofgoogle.org/Images/is_google_god.gif' alt='google2' class='alignleft' /> Another interesting site that comes up is <strong>http://www.thechurchofgoogle.org</strong>. This site claims Google to be the nearest to God where mankind have ever been to. It does not blindly worship Google as God but gives you 9 scientific/spiritual proof, for believing that. It says Google as<strong> Omniscient</strong> (all-knowing) and <strong>Omnibenevolent</strong> in a most logical fashion that no one can argue. The most interesting proof is proof#8

<code>According to Google trends, the term "Google" is searched for more than the terms "God", "Jesus", "Allah", "Buddha", "Christianity", "Islam", "Buddhism" and "Judaism"  combined. </code>

<strong>Result Analysis III:</strong>

You can find this on <strong>http://justfuckinggoogleit.com</strong>. It is just a site.. reminding the power of Google or claims "All Smart people user Google". Nice to own such a domain.

<strong>Result Analysis IV:</strong>

<a href='http://subesh.com.np/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/google4.jpg'><img src="http://subesh.com.np/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/google4.jpg" alt="" title="google4" width="293" height="307" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-75" /></a>

<strong>www.googlefight.com</strong>. This site makes a fight amongst the two keywords on the basis of total number of search results of the respective keywords returned from Google. It was fun.. at least to me while comparing with my name and friends name.

Guess this would be my last post for this year... and I would take a chance to wish you all a very <strong>HAPPY NEW YEAR.</strong>.. Keep Googling.. on Google.
