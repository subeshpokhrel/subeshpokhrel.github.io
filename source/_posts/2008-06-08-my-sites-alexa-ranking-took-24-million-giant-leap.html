I could not stop myself from posting this blog post, because it has been over four weeks I launched this site and its Alexa ranking has improved by 24 million in three days interval. As I first started it was around<strong> 29 Million</strong>. After a week it went to <strong>25 million </strong>figure, it was 25,214,769 on 5th June to be specific . And today on 8th June it has <strong>1,996,306</strong> ranking. So in three days the ranking took a 24 million leap. I don't know if its natural or "alexaral" but there is no any other  pleasure for those people, who keep on looking for their page rank or alexa rank of there site like me, to have such a giant leap.
