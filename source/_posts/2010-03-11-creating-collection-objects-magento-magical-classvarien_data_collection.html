Have you ever wondered how Collection in Magento are built, containing array of individual Entity Objects of Magento? Collections are one of the most important data structure (if I am right) used in Magento. Most of the queries in Magento will result into collection, and then you will apply a foreach loop to access individual Entity Objects and their values. Today I came into a different situation where I had individual objects but needed to create a collection of those objects, so that I could return the collection from a function.

I have not drilled down to the details of collection, untill today when I really need it! Do you think its very late? because I have been into Magento for more than a year now!. Better late than never! So, I got the way of working out my situation. Here is how I created a collection from Magento's "Magical Class" Varien_Data_Collection. I call this "Magical Class", because it worked like a Magic to me :D

[source language="php"]
$collection=new Varien_Data_Collection();
$collection-&gt;addItem($objProduct);
[/source]

There are various other functions in this class you might need to "work around" a problem. So, have a look and certainly do comment if you also think this class to be a Magical Class!
