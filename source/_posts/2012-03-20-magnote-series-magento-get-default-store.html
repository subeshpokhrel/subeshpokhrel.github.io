<blockquote><em>In this blog I have always shared about what I’ve learned on Magento, which I felt is taken me one step closer to understanding Magento and Magento development. But during the course of time, I bump on some elementary things which are absolutely required. So just for those elementary things I’ve decided to create a series (MagNotes Series) , for myself as a reference or for whoever think this is helpful.</em></blockquote>
