For last few days I have been trying to understand wordpress ins and outs, and had an idea of developing simple plugin for [wiki]wordpress[/wiki]. I thought people would want to give the reference of most of the words they use in their post to wikipedia, and placing it manually would be a very difficult task. Like the way I have done for the wordpress word above. So thought "wikilinki" would be a helpful plugin for those people.
And here I have it today the <strong>wikilinki</strong> plugin developed. This is just the initial version, I would add more functionality later. Because I am so excited to release it, I will add other things later on. Its easy to implement it just use <strong>[WIKI]Words[/WIKI] all in small</strong> on the post to get the reference URL of the word from wikipedia. I had to encode the usage because I have already installed it and it would parse it too. Place wikilinki.php under wp-content/plugins and activate from the admin.
You can download wikilinki from <a href="http://subeshexamples.googlecode.com/files/wikilinki.rar"><strong>Get Wikilinki (Updated)</strong></a>

If you want to change the color of the link then edit the colour code on $colour. I will add its settings working soon.
<strong>[UPDATE]</strong>
Settings edition added on new release.
If you have any suggestions or comment feel free ! Happy Blogging.
