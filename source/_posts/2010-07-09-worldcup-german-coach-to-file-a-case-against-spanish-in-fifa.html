Normally, I post tech stuff in my blog, but can't get away from football world cup fever. And my friend broke a news that German coach will file a case against Spanish, claiming that Germans should have also got the ball during the play at semis, because they were also playing the same game.

LOL!

Can't wait for the trial sessions.. HAHAHAHAHAHA

Go SPAIN!
