<a href="http://subesh.com.np/2012/02/ajaxify-v1-0-0-extension-to-help-in-working-with-ajax-in-magento-released-on-magento-connect/" title="Ajaxify" target="_blank">Ajaxify</a>, has been on Magento connect for sometimes now and it has reached over 200 downloads. I thought to put on github so that it can be enhanced collaboratively on <a href="https://github.com/subeshpokhrel/ajaxify" title="Ajaxify" target="_blank">https://github.com/subeshpokhrel/ajaxify</a>.

I am also working on the next release of the extension and will be updating there.
