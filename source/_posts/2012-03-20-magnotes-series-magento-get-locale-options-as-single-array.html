<blockquote><strong>About MagNotes Series</strong>
<em>In this blog I have always shared about what I’ve learned on Magento, which I felt is taken me one step closer to understanding Magento and Magento development. But during the course of time, I bump on some elementary things which are absolutely required. So just for those elementary things I’ve decided to create a series (MagNotes Series) , for myself as a reference or for whoever think this is helpful.</em></blockquote>

[source lang="php"]
             // Get all the locale options
                $locale = new Mage_Adminhtml_Model_System_Config_Source_Locale();
		$localSource = $locale-&gt;toOptionArray();
		
		// Change Options array to one dimentional array
		$localSourceCodes = array();
		foreach ($localSource as $source) {
			$localSourceCodes [$source ['value']] = $source ['label'];
		}
